    question:
      "Why do plants thrive in sunlight while struggling to grow in dark environments?",
    explanation:
      "Plants use photosynthesis to convert light energy into chemical energy. Without enough light, their energy production falters, leading to stunted growth.",

    question:
      "Why do certain animal species appear perfectly adapted to their environments over generations?",
    explanation:
      "Evolution through natural selection allows species to develop traits that are advantageous in their environments, resulting in well-adapted populations over time.",

    options: ["evolution", "homeostasis", "genetics", "ecology"],
  },
  {
    id: 3,
    question:
      "How can two siblings share many similarities yet exhibit distinct differences?",
    explanation:
      "Genetics explains that siblings inherit a mix of genes from their parents, which leads to both shared traits and individual differences.",

    question:
      "Why do you start sweating on a hot day, and how does your body avoid overheating?",
    explanation:
      "Homeostasis is the body's mechanism to maintain a stable internal temperature. Sweating cools the body, preventing overheating during high temperatures.",
